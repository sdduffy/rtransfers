Description: Simple function for calling the Journal Transfer API within R
    The current iteration of this package has 1 simple function, rtransfers, which appends
    a query string to the API BaseURL and return the results. There are roughly 23 different 
    index labels for the Journal Transfer API. For example, if you wanted to just check receiving publisher
    you would call "rpn: Springer" with the function. However, if you wanted to check Springer for transfers that
    became effective on January 1, 2019. You would call "rpn: Springer AND etd: 2019-01-01". The plan is to
    update this and make it more user friendly going forward. The full list of Index Mnemonics can be found
